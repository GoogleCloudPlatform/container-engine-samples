# Hello Application with IAP example

> **Note:** This application is a copy of [hello-app](../hello-app) sample.
> See that directory for more details on this sample.

This sample web application opens two ports of hello-app to serve two services. Both services
are binding to the `backendconfig`, which enables Cloud IAP for each service. By setting Cloud IAP,
you could have different access configurations for each path and verify it by this sample.
